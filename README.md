# 1507Labs

Welcome to **1507Labs**, the experimental engineering playground for Team 1507.  
This repository is dedicated to **research, prototyping, and rapid iteration** — a space where new ideas can be explored freely before graduating into production‑ready code.

## Purpose

1507Labs exists to support:

- **early‑stage subsystem prototypes** — drivetrain experiments, shooter logic, sensor pipelines  
- **algorithm research** — control theory, feedforward tuning, path planning, state estimation  
- **utility development** — testing tools, logging systems, calibration helpers  
- **architecture exploration** — new patterns, abstractions, and design approaches  

Nothing here needs to be perfect. It just needs to move the team forward.

## Relationship to Other Repositories

- **1507Base** — our stable, season‑starter template. Only polished, battle‑tested features graduate into this repo.  
- **QuestNavJava** — the dedicated home for navigation, vision, and autonomous research.  
- **1507Labs** — everything else: prototypes, experiments, and future‑season ideas.

This separation keeps our production code clean while giving us room to innovate.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Prototype subsystems**  
- **Experimental control loops**  
- **Hardware test harnesses**  
- **New utilities and tools**  
- **Documentation of experiments**  

Expect things to change quickly — that’s the point.

## Contribution Philosophy

- **Build fast, document clearly.**  
- **Break things safely.**  
- **Promote only what’s proven.**  
- **Keep experiments isolated and readable.**  

If a feature shows promise, it can be refined and proposed for inclusion in **1507Base**.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Explore the `/experiments` and `/prototypes` directories  
3. Read any notes or wikis attached to active projects  
4. Start building something new

If you want, I can also help you create:

- a **directory structure** for 1507Labs  
- a **wiki template** for documenting experiments  
- a **promotion workflow** (Labs → Base)  
- or a **badge/header graphic** for the README

Which direction feels most fun to explore next — **structure**, **workflow**, or **documentation style**?
