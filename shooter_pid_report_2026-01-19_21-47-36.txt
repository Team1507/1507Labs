=== Shooter PID + Feedforward Tuning Test Starting ===

=== Shooter PID Phase Report ===
Phase: SLOW_UP_STEP
  Target: 400.0 RPM
  CATASTROPHIC FAILURE: Shooter cannot reach target RPM.
  Max RPM achieved: 0.0 RPM
  Recommendation: Shooter reached only 0% of target. Suggested new kV = 0.0000 (current kV = 0.0000).
  Feedforward Recommendation: Increase kV.
